Penneo is a fast-growing RegTech SaaS company headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.

We successfully serve customers in industries like accounting, law, finance, enabling them to handle documents, data and signing in a secure and compliant way.

We are now ready to take the next step by going global and exploring new business growth.

### Why Join?

At Penneo you will work together with a multicultural team of highly skilled, open-minded and enthusiastic developers to develop and maintain our customer facing products. We work with:

- React,
- Redux
- Webpack
- TypeScript.

Experience with these is a plus, but not required.

We don’t hire people just for their technical skills. We also want your input and ideas about the way we do things and our products.

If we didn’t, we’d only get half our money’s worth. We promise you a great opportunity to take your skills to the next level and have a lot of fun while doing it!

Denmark is the happiest country in the world, so even if you have to relocate, you shouldn’t worry.

We’ve got you covered! We have a very international and closely knitted team that is always happy to help and enjoy the good times together.

### Company Asset

At Penneo, our most important asset is PEOPLE. We’re not looking for new employees, we’re looking for new teammates. We strive to do what we love, to love what we do and to make every day fun and engaging. In other words, we are a PEOPLE company!

- We’re not afraid to take responsibility for our mistakes and to learn from them
- We’re accountable and have integrity
