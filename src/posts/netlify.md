There was a time when hosting a website used to be complicated and quite expensive. Luckily we now have different services like Netlify, which makes deploying websites a seamless experience.

Just to be transparent, this post is not sponsored by Netlify or anything. I just really like their service and have published a good amount of sites on their platform.

And so with that in mind, here are five reasons why you might want to consider using Netlify the next time you want to publish a static site.

## 1. Hosting & Price

Properly the best thing about Netlify is its different plans and what they offer in terms of perks. For example, they have a starter plan which offers:

- Custom domains & HTTPS
- Instant Git integration
- Continuous deployment
- Deploy previews

And the total cost of all that comes down to zero. Hosting is done through a CDN, which speeds up website performance significantly.

## 2. Easy to use dashboard

The dashboard gives you a good overview of everything from deploys to previews, and it is just overall easy to navigate if you want to make some changes on your site.
