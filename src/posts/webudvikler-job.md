Finding a web developer job can be a lot. Especially if it's your first job. Therefore, we have put together some tips that which hopefully can lead to asking a web developer position.

When searching for a web developer job it is very important that you show the employer proof that you can build applications. Therefore, it is a very good idea to have an online portfolio that shows your projects as well as contact info.

## 2. Be active on social media

One way you can stand out from other applicants seeking the same web developer position as you is by being active on social media.

It can be media such as Twitter, Instagram or Linkedin. This is an advantage because the employer can gain a better insight into how you are as a person and how passionate you are about being able to code.
